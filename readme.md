Pygame with reinforcement learning

Install using coda or venv
Then `pip install -t requirements.txt`

Things one can do:

- Run the game and play it: `python main.py`. Use arrows to move, ESC to quit
- Train a model using `training_pipe.py`
- Playback a trained model using `model_player.py` (just give the code the folder path of the trained model)
